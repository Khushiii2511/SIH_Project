          <p className="section-description">
            Many government schools in Nabha and nearby rural areas lack updated computer infrastructure, reliable internet connectivity, and access to quality digital educational resources. Teachers and students struggle to use outdated systems, and digital literacy remains low. As a result, students face difficulties in learning essential digital skills and accessing modern educational content, leading to a widening gap between rural and urban education standards.

          <h3 className="section-title">Why this problem needs to be solved</h3>
          <p className="section-description">
            The lack of digital resources and skills limits studentsâ€™ academic growth and future employability. With the increasing importance of digital literacy, students in rural Nabha risk being left behind, perpetuating cycles of educational and economic disadvantage. Addressing this problem is urgent to ensure equitable access to quality education and to empower rural youth with skills for the modern world.
